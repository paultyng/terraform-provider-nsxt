# nsxt_policy_host_transport_node_profile

This resource provides a method for the management of a Policy Host Transport Node Profile.
This resource is supported with NSX 4.1.0 onwards.

## Example Usage
```hcl
resource "nsxt_policy_host_transport_node_profile" "test" {
  display_name = "test_policy_host_tnp"

  standard_host_switch {
    host_switch_mode = "STANDARD"
    host_switch_type = "NVDS"
    ip_assignment {
      assigned_by_dhcp = true
    }
    transport_zone_endpoint {
      transport_zone = nsxt_policy_transport_zone.tz_overlay.path
    }
    host_switch_profile = [nsxt_policy_uplink_host_switch_profile.hsw_profile1.path]
    is_migrate_pnics    = false
    pnic {
      device_name = "fp-eth0"
      uplink_name = "uplink1"
    }
  }
}
```

```
terraform import nsxt_policy_host_transport_node_profile.test POLICY_PATH
```
The above command imports Policy Host Transport Node Profile named `test` with NSX policy path `POLICY_PATH`.
